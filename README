styles/mymacro/*		Macros I defined to make my TeX life more comfortable :-D


[Compilation]
1.	Move 'styles' directory to which your TeX has a path.
    In my case,

          $ sudo mv styles/* /usr/local/teTeX/share/texmf/ptex/platex/

2. Execute 'mktexlsr' to add styles/* to TeX system.

           $ sudo mktexlsr

3. Compile the main file. Note that you may have to compile it a few times to resolve some dependencies
    (ex: 'label' and 'ref', files and files)

         $ latex main.tex

4. Now, you get 'main.dvi'. If you want PDF formated file, execute dvipdfmx command.

        $ dvipdfmx main.dvi
